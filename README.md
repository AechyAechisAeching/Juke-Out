<h1>My first webgame for a school assigment</h1>

The name I have given it is "Juke Out"
I have made it with Javascript, html and css

The goal of "Juke out" is to dodge the incoming enemies wich are the balls all over the canvas, if u collide with the enemy u lose.
Collect as many cystals as possible for a better score!
This game is in BETA so dont judge me yet

Bugs:
The startscreen is not doing so good with the main screen due css div

Solutions:
Make the enemy spawn from the corners or they start at the middle
Make the game menu so ur cursor will be already at center
Recreate the faces cus of quality :thumbsdown:
about the fps drops you have to deal with it. no jk uh just wait for the end result to debug that later on

Created a github desktop for the files
