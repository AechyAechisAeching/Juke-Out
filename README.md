My first webgame for a school assigment

The name I have given it is "Juke Out"
I have made it with Javascript, html and css

The goal of "Juke out" is to dodge the incoming enemies wich are the balls all over the canvas, if u hit the enemy u die.
Collect as many cystals as possible for a better score!
This game is in BETA so dont judge me yet haha
