<h1>My first webgame for a school assigment</h1>

The name I have given it is "Juke Out"
I have made it with Javascript, html and css

The goal of "Juke out" is to dodge the incoming enemies wich are the balls all over the canvas, if u collide with the enemy u lose.
Collect as many cystals as possible for a better score!
This game is in BETA so dont judge me yet
Random Positioning for crystal is done
Hitboxes are performing excellent

TODO:
Waves
score
Game over menu collapse
Start menu

Features:
Make the balls always spawn at the corners because u have chance to die when just starting to play


TODO ON SCHOOL:
MAKE THE FACES MORE COLOURFUL WITH THE HELP OF PAINT BECAUSE IT JUST SUCKS TO LOOK AT IT

Positioning tutorial:
https://p5js.org/examples/calculating-values-random/

Bugs:
Currently spawncamping,
When the character spawns it has a chance to immediately get hit by one of the enemies wich HURTS A LOT
Quality is very bad
fps drops

Solutions:
Make the enemy spawn from the corners or they start at the middle
Make the game menu so ur cursor will be already at center
Recreate the faces cus of quality :thumbsdown:
about the fps drops you have to deal with it. no jk uh just wait for the end result to debug that later on

Created a github desktop for the files
